	{ "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--  This is equivalent to:
	--    require('Comment').setup({})

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end

	-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
	-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
	-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
	--
	-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

			local statusline = require("mini.statusline")
			-- set use_icons to true if you have a Nerd Font
			statusline.setup({ use_icons = vim.g.have_nerd_font })

			-- You can configure sections in the statusline by overriding their
			-- default behavior. For example, here we set the section for
			-- cursor location to LINE:COLUMN
			---@diagnostic disable-next-line: duplicate-set-field
			statusline.section_location = function()
				return "%2l:%-2v"

	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require("custom.plugins.git_signs"),
	-- require("custom.plugins.indent_line"),

	-- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
	--    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
	--
	--  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
	--    For additional information, see `:help lazy.nvim-lazy.nvim-structuring-your-plugins`
